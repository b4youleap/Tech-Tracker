/*  Global application styles
When we add styles to a component, we're keeping everything a component needs — HTML, 
the CSS, the code — together in one convenient place. It's pretty easy to package it 
all up and re-use the component somewhere else.

We can also create styles at the application level outside of any component.

Our designers provided some basic styles to apply to elements across the entire app. 
These correspond to the full set of master styles that we introduced earlier (see QuickStart, "Add some style").
