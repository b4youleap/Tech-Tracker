<!-- Notes from the Routing Tutorial:
The AppComponent should only handle navigation. Let's move the display of Technologies out of AppComponent and into 
its own TechnologiesComponent.

    The routerLinkActive directive

The Angular Router provides a routerLinkActive directive we can use to add a class to the HTML navigation element whose 
route matches the active route. All we have to do is define the style for it. Sweet!

    Thoughts:
I wonder if the AppComponent really is the best place for nav - wouldn't the shell of an app include nav, sidebars
and footers? Should there be a shared layout component?
